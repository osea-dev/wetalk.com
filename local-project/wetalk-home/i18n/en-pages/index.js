                During the period of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors in ancient China, people became destitute and homeless due to frequent floods. Gun and his son Yu were appointed by Yao and Shun emperors to tame the flooding. Yu drew lessons from his father's failure. Instead of directly damming the rivers' flow, Yu made a system of irrigation canals that relieved floodwater into fields and dredged the riverbeds. Respecting nature is the correct and reasonable application of the law of nature.

                After 13 years, he finally controlled the flooding. Later, temples and halls were built to memorize his great deeds and he was worshiped as the God of Yu.

                Nature has infinite power. Man as part of nature should live in harmony with nature, rather than dominate it. This element highlights the relationship between man and nature. "We are all sheltered by the same sky and we all live on the same planet Earth".

                Fist-and-palm salute is a modest way to show respect for others. Usually, the right hand holds the fist inside and the left hand clenches the fist outside. Both of them are closed in front of the chest. As Zuo Zhuan (The Zuo Tradition) 18th Year of Duke Wen of Lu records, "The Rites of Zhou was edited by the Duke of Zhou." The culture of rites and music of the Zhou Dynasty is mainly recorded in three ancient ritual classics, namely the Rites of Zhou, the Book of Etiquette and Rites, and the Book of Rites.

                Confucius said, "Do not do unto others what you do not want others do unto you" This is the foundation and premise for the Great Unity. To achieve harmony with nature, we must first live in harmony with others. Only by seeking harmony in diversity and through mutual respect can we achieve coexistence and sustainable development.

                It was earliest recorded in the Free and Easy Wandering, the first chapter of the Zhuangzi. "In the Northern Ocean there is a fish, the name of which is Kun—I do not know how many li in size. It changes into a bird with the name of Peng, the back of which is (also)—I do not know how many li in extent. When this bird rouses itself and flies, its wings are like clouds all around the sky. When the sea is moved (so as to bear it along), it prepares to remove to the Southern Ocean. The Southern Ocean is the Pool of Heaven. "

                The Northern Ocean stands for desire and motivation, while the Southern Ocean represents wisdom and the Way of Heaven. Kun Peng flying from the Northern Ocean to the Southern Ocean symbolizes the process that wisdom is on top of desire and pushes people to pursue the Way of Heaven.

                As a saying goes, "Past experience, if not forgotten, is a guide for the future." However, the premise is that we can get something new from past experience. We gain new knowledge often by reviewing old knowledge. Alongside historical development and civilization advancement, significant knowledge and experiences have been deposited to deal with the relationship between man, society, and nature. To explore the future, it is the safest and wisest way to learn from past experiences and acquire the new from the old.
