He and Laozi are collectively called "Lao Zhuang" (literally Laozi and Zhuangzi). Zhuangzi inherited and carried forward Taoism as well as created his unique philosophical thoughts and styles of learning and writing. His works are collected in the Zhuangzi, which was given the honorific title Scripture of Southern Florescence or Nanhuajing after the Han Dynasty, thus Zhuangzi is praised as "Nanhua Zhenren (Daoist spiritual master)". The Zhuangzi, Tao Te Ching, and the Book of Changes are collectively called Sanxuan or Three Mystic Learnings.
