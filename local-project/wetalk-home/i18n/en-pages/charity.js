            `As a Chinese idea goes, "The highest excellence is like (that of) water." Benevolence is a time-honored and world-recognized idea and behavior as well as a social civilization shared by all mankind. Throughout history, China has upheld the philanthropic behaviors that help the poor and the difficult, developing the fine tradition of doing good for people and the world. Good deeds for public interests were exemplified in actions, such as the establishment of public communes and schools and the supply of free rice by village families, relief of poor and sick people by religious monasteries, government's disaster relief by offering national stored grain, and social efforts to help vulnerable groups. `,
            "Benevolence has been kept from generation to generation, setting a standard for the eternal traditional virtue and morality of human civilization.<br/><br/>Starting from our own, we are committed to providing youth education, advancing the development of poverty-stricken areas, caring for vulnerable groups, and supporting disaster relief and poverty alleviation. So far, WeTalk has carried out several public benefit projects around the world to actively fulfill corporate responsibility and contribute to the harmony of human civilization.",
